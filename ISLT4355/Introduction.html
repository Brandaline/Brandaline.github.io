            Hello! My name is Brandi Whitmore and I am a fourth year student planning to obtain a bachelor's degree in Information Technology. I also plan to obtain several certificates relating to the Information Technology field. I do currently have a bit of web application development experience. Due to the experience I have, I already know a lot of html. I am hoping to learn a bit more in depth on how to use .css, which is helpful in making websites more aesthetically pleasing. I'm also looking forward to learning how to implement responsive web design with mobile devices as well. I really would like to use the skills I learn in this class to help me become a better web developer. In my free time I enjoy playing different video games. I enjoy all video games but lately my go to game is a story based game titled <i>Beyond: Two Souls</i>.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
            My name is Brandi Whitmore. I am a fourth year student at the University of Missouri. 
            I plan on attending college for <em>five</em> years. At the end of the five years, I plan on 
            obtaining <em>four</em> certificates and a degree in Information Technology. Growing up I always 
            liked video games and wanted to learn how they worked. I knew from a young age that I 
            wanted to get a job in a tech related field. I still really enjoy playing video games 
            when I can. <br> I am a proud pet owner of <b>two</b> loving and playful cats. I have always been 
            creative and have picked up several different hobbies. I really enjoy music. I can and 
            enjoy playing several instruments, singing, and dancing. I enjoy crafting different 
            items as well. My most recent project has been turning charms into cute earrings. At 
            one point, I even made coasters out of resin.

        Welcome to my professional portfolio!
    </h2>

    <p>
        My name is Brandi Whitmore and the purpose of this portfolio is to give you an idea about some of my experiences and learn more about who I am as you navigate through the different web pages I have created and designed. On this website there are multiple different places to view and go. This is my home page but there are pages describing different projects I have been a part of, my personal reflection on my career so far, and one that has a little bit of extra information about me. My goal with this website is for you to better get to know me and some of the projects I have done. I also aim to give you a better idea of what projects I enjoy and look forward to creating in the future. Enjoy exploring and taking a moment to discover more about me and the projects I have already been a part of.

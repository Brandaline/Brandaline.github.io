    <h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
   
    <p class="letter">So far in my journey into the technology field, 
        I have learned a lot and I have many things to reflect on already. 
        I have been a part of several different projects at this point in 
        time and each one has taught me something new. I have always been 
        a visual and kinesthetic learner and accomplishing these projects 
        allowed me to truly ingrain the multiple things I had learned. At 
        this point I have mainly participated in digital media projects and
        I honestly have really enjoyed these types of projects. </p>
    
    <p class="para">Looking back I have always been interested in different 
        digital media projects from video editing, commercials that use digital
        effects, photo editing, and so much more. I had always wanted to learn
        how different video effects were created and applied and because of this
        I have been invested in learning all that I can. I was taught in various 
        classes different techniques on how to apply different effects in Adobe 
        After Effects. I am proud of how much I have learned and how well I am 
        able to apply the techniques I have learned. I now have the capability 
        to produce work that is professional, realistic, and attention grabbing.</p>

    <p class="para">I have also discovered that I have a passion for and enjoy 
        the creation of websites. So far I have done more and know more of the
        front end side but I have been interested and plan on learning more on
        the backend side of web development. I have learned a bit of Javascript
        and I have learned a bit about how servers play into web development. I 
        have also always been interested in AR and VR and when I first heard of 
        photogrammetry I was instantly curious. I have since learned how to make 
        models that can be accessed in VR or AR using different methods of 
        photogrammetry.</p>

    <h2>Carrer Goals</h2>
    <p class="para">When it comes to my career, my main goal is that I want to 
        obtain a job in a digital media setting. Since I have always been interested 
        in digital media I know that I will be invested in the work that I do. With 
        being invested I hope to expand my skill set and learn as much as I can. My 
        goal is to constantly produce work that I am proud of. I want to produce 
        work that would make my younger self, who had no idea where to even begin 
        learning how to create these kinds of things, proud of how far I have come 
        and learned. I would like to be able to be an example of how anyone can learn 
        how to create the things that they enjoy.</p>
